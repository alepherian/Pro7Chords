# These files were removed to fix Core Data compilation conflicts
# 
# The Core Data model is now set to use "category/extension" generation
# which means Xcode auto-generates the base classes and we provide
# extensions with our custom functionality.
#
# Removed files:
# - ChordChart+CoreDataClass.swift
# - ChordChart+CoreDataProperties.swift  
# - ChordPositionEntity+CoreDataClass.swift
# - ChordPositionEntity+CoreDataProperties.swift
#
# Replaced with:
# - ChordChart+Extensions.swift (business logic)
# - ChordPositionEntity+Extensions.swift (business logic)
#
# Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
