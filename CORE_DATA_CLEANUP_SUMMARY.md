# Core Data Cleanup Summary
# Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## Problem
Multiple commands produce the same .swiftconstvalues files because both manual Core Data 
class files AND auto-generated files were present.

## Solution Applied
1. Updated .xcdatamodel to use "category/extension" generation mode
2. Removed manual Core Data class files
3. Created extension files with custom business logic
4. Xcode now auto-generates base classes, we provide extensions

## Files That Should Remain
- ChordChart+Extensions.swift (custom business logic)
- ChordPositionEntity+Extensions.swift (custom business logic)
- ChordModel.swift (unchanged)

## Files Removed (moved to .REMOVED)
- ChordChart+CoreDataClass.swift
- ChordChart+CoreDataProperties.swift  
- ChordPositionEntity+CoreDataClass.swift
- ChordPositionEntity+CoreDataProperties.swift

## Xcode Will Auto-Generate
- ChordChart class with properties
- ChordPositionEntity class with properties

## Build Should Now Work
No more conflicts between manual and auto-generated files.
